##ODE-Solver-Parallel    
- This repository contains code for solving a linear differential equation using Finite difference method in parallel. A special C library has been used for parallelizing, called MUltiutility Massively Parallel sparse Solver (MUMPS). Code contains both cpp and c files linked using makefile.
- ***The code contains in this repository solves ODE based on the inputted boundary condition by the user once only and does not auto-generate boundary conditions for iteratively solving ODE.***
- For iteratively solving ODE with auto-generative boundary conditions, check another repository on my account by the name of `ODE-Solver-Parallel-2`.
